#### 7) Create a README file to answer the following question-


#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?











1. The difference between var let and const 

var. It allows the user to set a vaiable in javascript but it has a problem it can be used before declaration but the value returns undefined. It also allows users to change the value inside or assign a new value to it.

let is mathod of declaring a variable that is very flexible. It allows the user to change the variable inside assign new value to it. it is block scoped.

const. Its value always stays constant. Meaning you can not assign a new value to it. but you can remove or add onto it.


2.  The difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()
map(). loops through each element and returns a new array

forEach(). It takes an array as a input and runs loop for each element insdie the array

filter(). It runs loop for all the elemnts in an array but only returns the element that matchs the curtain given condition.


3. The arrow functions in ES6

It is a shorthand technique of wirting a function. 


4. The destructuring assignment work in ES6

Destructuring in javascript is a way to unpack values from arrays or object into separate variables precisly


5. Explaining template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation

tamplate literal is the work by using backticks (``) instead of original quots and double quots. It is very powerful and very useful. It allows you write multiple line
in a single backtick container. The most useful case of tamplate literal is that it allows user to put js variables and values directly inside it making it very dynamic.
